Hello!

1. This is the mini project of group #1. The group consists of Matilda Segerlund and 
   Magnus Stenfelt (matseg-9@student.ltu.se, magset-8@student.ltu.se).

4. Link to data used in the miniproject (we used one data set): 

Our mini project is facial expression recognition using a convolutional neural network. It takes about 1h to run a test 
with the current learning rate, just a heads up :)

To reach grade 4, we've tested several different optimizers and loss functions to find the best solution. All tests are 
commented in the code, along with the results (if you don't want to run the tests yourself). 

How to replicate our results:
