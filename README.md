Hello!

1. This is the mini project of group #1. The group consists of Matilda Segerlund and 
   Magnus Stenfelt (matseg-9@student.ltu.se, magset-8@student.ltu.se).

4. Link to data used in the miniproject (we used one data set): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

Our mini project is facial expression recognition using a convolutional neural network. It takes about 1h to run a test 
with the current learning rate, just a heads up :)

To reach grade 4, we've tested several different optimizers and loss functions to find the best solution. All tests are 
commented in the code, along with the results (if you don't want to run the tests yourself). 

How to replicate our results: 

For this miniproject we used anaconda3 to run jupyter notebook. Anaconda can be downloaded at https://www.anaconda.com/.
When you have downloaded anaconda you can clone the git reposatory to your computer.
From there on there are a few things that will be needed.

Step 1. Download all packages/frameworks that is needed to run the fer_final file. 
The commands in anaconda are:
conda install -c anaconda numpy,
conda install -c anaconda pandas,
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow,
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib,
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn

Step 2. Change the path of the dataset in fer_final to whatever path it has on your computer

Step 3. To run the file just run all lines until you get to the dotted line

Step 4. To see the resulting guessing from the best model run the code under the dotted line

Step ?. When it does not work either contact us through our contact information or watch the top link of our references
